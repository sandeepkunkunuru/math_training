# Introduction to Vehicle Routing Problems

Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) are a class of combinatorial optimization problems that involve finding optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods or services to a set of customers.

## Key Components of Vehicle Routing Problems

1. **Depot**: The starting and ending location for vehicles
2. **Customers/Locations**: Points that need to be visited
3. **Vehicles**: Resources with capacities and constraints
4. **Routes**: Sequences of locations visited by each vehicle
5. **Constraints**: Limitations on routes, vehicles, and deliveries
6. **Objective Function**: Typically minimizing distance, time, or cost

## Common Variants of VRP

1. **Capacitated VRP (CVRP)**: Vehicles have limited capacity
2. **VRP with Time Windows (VRPTW)**: Customers must be visited within specific time windows
3. **Multi-Depot VRP (MDVRP)**: Multiple starting/ending locations for vehicles
4. **VRP with Pickup and Delivery (VRPPD)**: Items must be picked up and delivered
5. **Open VRP**: Vehicles don't need to return to the depot
6. **Heterogeneous Fleet VRP**: Vehicles have different capacities and costs

## Mathematical Formulation

A simplified formulation of the basic VRP:

- Let $G = (V, A)$ be a graph where $V = \{0, 1, ..., n\}$ is the set of vertices and $A$ is the set of arcs
- Vertex 0 represents the depot, and vertices $1, ..., n$ represent customers
- Let $c_{ij}$ be the cost of traveling from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$
- Let $K$ be the set of available vehicles
- Let $x_{ijk}$ be a binary variable that equals 1 if vehicle $k$ travels from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$, and 0 otherwise

Objective: Minimize $\sum_{i \in V} \sum_{j \in V} \sum_{k \in K} c_{ij} x_{ijk}$

Subject to various constraints like:
- Each customer is visited exactly once
- Each vehicle starts and ends at the depot
- Capacity constraints
- Flow conservation constraints

## Solution Approaches

1. **Exact Methods**:
   - Branch and Bound
   - Branch and Cut
   - Dynamic Programming (for small instances)

2. **Heuristics**:
   - Savings Algorithm (Clarke-Wright)
   - Sweep Algorithm
   - Insertion Heuristics

3. **Metaheuristics**:
   - Tabu Search
   - Simulated Annealing
   - Genetic Algorithms
   - Ant Colony Optimization

4. **Hybrid Approaches**:
   - Matheuristics (combining mathematical programming and heuristics)
   - Constraint Programming with Local Search

## Applications of VRP

- Delivery and logistics
- Waste collection
- Snow plowing
- Home healthcare services
- School bus routing
- Maintenance scheduling

## OR-Tools and VRP

Google's OR-Tools provides powerful capabilities for solving VRPs through its routing library, which combines:
- Constraint programming
- Local search
- Metaheuristics
- Large neighborhood search

The library can handle complex constraints and large problem instances efficiently.
