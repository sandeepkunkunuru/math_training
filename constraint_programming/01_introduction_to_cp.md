# Introduction to Constraint Programming

Constraint Programming (CP) is a paradigm for solving combinatorial problems that draws on a wide range of techniques from artificial intelligence, computer science, and operations research.

## Key Concepts in Constraint Programming

1. **Variables**: Unknowns that need to be assigned values
2. **Domains**: Possible values each variable can take
3. **Constraints**: Rules that restrict the combinations of values that variables can take
4. **Propagation**: Process of reducing domains based on constraints
5. **Search**: Strategy for exploring the solution space

## Differences Between Linear Programming and Constraint Programming

| Linear Programming | Constraint Programming |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Continuous variables | Typically discrete variables |
| Linear constraints only | Various types of constraints |
| Optimization focus | Feasibility and optimization |
| Uses mathematical algorithms (simplex, interior point) | Uses constraint propagation and search |
| Well-suited for resource allocation | Well-suited for scheduling, planning, configuration |

## Common Constraint Types

1. **Arithmetic Constraints**: x + y = z, x â‰¤ y, etc.
2. **Logical Constraints**: AND, OR, NOT, implications
3. **Global Constraints**: AllDifferent, Circuit, Cumulative, etc.
4. **Reified Constraints**: Constraints that can be true or false

## Solving Process in Constraint Programming

1. **Modeling**: Formulate the problem in terms of variables, domains, and constraints
2. **Propagation**: Reduce domains by enforcing constraints
3. **Search**: Systematically explore the solution space
4. **Backtracking**: When a dead end is reached, undo decisions and try alternatives

## Applications of Constraint Programming

- Scheduling (job shop, employee rostering)
- Planning (logistics, manufacturing)
- Configuration (product configuration, network design)
- Puzzles (Sudoku, crosswords)
- Resource allocation with complex constraints
