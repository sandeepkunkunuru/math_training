## Getting Started

1. Review the `optimization_learning_plan.md` file for a structured learning path
2. Install OR-Tools and dependencies (see below)
3. Work through the examples in order of increasing complexity

## Installing OR-Tools

For Python:
```bash
pip install ortools
```

For other languages and more detailed installation instructions, refer to the [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/optimization/install).

## Learning Path

The recommended learning path is:

1. **Mathematical Foundations** (linear algebra, calculus, probability)
2. **Linear Programming** basics and simplex method
3. **Constraint Programming** concepts and CSP solving
4. **Integer and Mixed-Integer Programming** with branch and bound
5. **Network Flows** and graph algorithms
6. **Specialized topics** (routing, scheduling, metaheuristics)

Each directory contains examples with increasing complexity, starting with basic concepts and progressing to more advanced topics.
