# Optimization Mathematics Learning Project

This repository contains learning materials, examples, and exercises to help learn optimization mathematics from scratch, with a focus on understanding and eventually contributing to Google's OR-Tools project.

## Directory Structure

- **linear_programming/**: Examples and exercises focused on linear programming concepts
- **constraint_programming/**: Materials related to constraint programming and satisfaction problems
- **integer_programming/**: Examples of integer and mixed-integer programming problems
- **routing/**: Vehicle routing problems and solutions
- **examples/**: General examples covering various optimization topics
- **resources/**: Additional learning resources, cheat sheets, and references

## Getting Started

1. Review the `optimization_learning_plan.md` file for a structured learning path
2. Install OR-Tools and dependencies (see below)
3. Work through the examples in order of increasing complexity

## Installing OR-Tools

For Python:
```bash
pip install ortools
```

For other languages and more detailed installation instructions, refer to the [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/optimization/install).

## Learning Path

The recommended learning path is:

1. Linear Programming basics
2. Constraint Programming concepts
3. Integer and Mixed-Integer Programming
4. Specialized topics (routing, scheduling, etc.)

Each directory contains examples with increasing complexity, starting with basic concepts and progressing to more advanced topics.
