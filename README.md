## Getting Started

1. Review the `optimization_learning_plan.md` file for a structured learning path
2. Install OR-Tools and dependencies (see below)
3. Work through the examples in order of increasing complexity

## Installing OR-Tools

For Python:
```bash
pip install ortools
```

For other languages and more detailed installation instructions, refer to the [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/optimization/install).

## Quick Start - Testing Implementations

All C++ implementations can be compiled and tested individually:

```bash
# Constraint Programming
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 cpp_implementations/constraint_programming/constraint_satisfaction.cpp -o csp_test
./csp_test

# Integer Programming
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 cpp_implementations/integer_programming/branch_and_bound.cpp -o bb_test
./bb_test

# Network Flows
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 cpp_implementations/network_flows/max_flow.cpp -o flow_test
./flow_test

# Routing (TSP)
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 cpp_implementations/routing/traveling_salesman.cpp -o tsp_test
./tsp_test

# Scheduling
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 cpp_implementations/scheduling/job_shop_scheduling.cpp -o jsp_test
./jsp_test

# Metaheuristics
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 cpp_implementations/metaheuristics/simulated_annealing.cpp -o sa_test
./sa_test
```

## Learning Path

The recommended learning path is:

1. **Mathematical Foundations** (linear algebra, calculus, probability)
2. **Linear Programming** basics and simplex method
3. **Constraint Programming** concepts and CSP solving
4. **Integer and Mixed-Integer Programming** with branch and bound
5. **Network Flows** and graph algorithms
6. **Specialized topics** (routing, scheduling, metaheuristics)

Each directory contains examples with increasing complexity, starting with basic concepts and progressing to more advanced topics.
